## About Functional Projects (IMPORTANT)

Only the **MY PHOTOGRAPHY COLLECTION** works directly in the online website.

Other interactive or functional projects—such as:
Any project requiring **Java / Spring Boot / local backend** or programs that need **engine execution**
cannot be run through GitHub Pages because they require a **backend server**.

### To use those projects, please visit my GitHub profile and download the corresponding repository:

From there you can:
- Clone or download the source code  
- Run the project locally following the instructions provided  
- Access their full interactive functionality
